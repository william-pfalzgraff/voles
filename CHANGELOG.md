## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Deterministic Gauss-Jacobi quadrature for weakly singular kernels.**
  `kernel_singularity` on the callable-input solvers now also accepts the
  singularity exponent -- a dict `{location: alpha}` or `(location, alpha)`
  pairs, declaring `K(u) ~ |u - u0|^{-alpha}` with `0 < alpha < 1`. Singular
  weight blocks whose declared singularities carry exponents are evaluated by
  fixed-order Gauss-Jacobi rules that build the singular factor into the
  quadrature weight exactly (interior singular points split the block into
  one-sided pieces), guarded by the same two-order acceptance check as the
  smooth Gauss-Legendre path with per-basis adaptive fallback -- a wrong
  exponent degrades bit-identically to the adaptive path. The blocks are
  deterministic, so they join the uniform-mesh Toeplitz reuse set under the
  strict reproducibility policy: Abel-kernel assembly runs ~16-19x faster
  than the per-row adaptive path with no opt-in flag (Abel VIE-2, p=3,
  M=1280: 3.8 s -> 0.24 s), equal-lag singular blocks are bitwise equal, and
  the vector path sheds its `quad_vec` tolerance errors (~1e-8 -> ~1e-15
  against an independent reference). Deviations from the adaptive path are
  bounded by the acceptance tolerance (worst measured 1.2e-9 scale-relative
  across a 56-case A/B battery; all 46 legacy-form cases bit-identical). A
  companion kwarg `singular_quadrature='auto'|'adaptive'` (default `'auto'`)
  forces the historical adaptive path when set to `'adaptive'`. Bare
  locations, lists, and callables keep the historical behavior bit for bit.
  See `notes/gauss_jacobi_notes.pdf` on the branch for derivations,
  verification, and benchmarks.

- **`reuse_adaptive_blocks` flag** on the callable-input solvers
  (`function_solve_VIE_1/2`, `function_solve_VIDE`). On uniform meshes with
  convolution kernels the weight tensor is assembled from one integrated row;
  by default only deterministic fixed-order (Gauss-Legendre) blocks are
  reused across rows, and adaptive-quadrature blocks (declared singularities
  and two-order fallbacks) are re-evaluated per row, which reproduces the
  general assembly to rounding level. With the flag, the adaptive blocks are
  reused too -- computed once at tightened tolerance, so they are at least as
  accurate as the per-row values they replace. The singular-kernel build cost
  drops by roughly another order of magnitude (Abel VIE-1, p=3, M=320:
  ~1 s -> ~0.02 s), at the price of deviations from the default path bounded
  by the adaptive quadrature's own tolerance (~1e-8, typically ~1e-9) -- far
  below discretization error in practice. Default `False`; strict no-op on
  non-uniform meshes and for smooth kernels.

### Documentation
- The install/dependency instructions are now single-sourced: the README
  install block is the canonical copy, and the docs site pulls it in via a
  snippet, so the two can no longer drift. Fixed the stale docs that still
  described `scipy` as an optional `[callable]` extra (it has been a core
  dependency since 0.6.0).
- Measured benchmark tables moved from the README to a dedicated
  `docs/benchmarks.md` page (the README keeps the asymptotic-complexity table
  and links out). The benchmark CI job now regenerates that page instead of the
  README, and was hardened to never commit Git conflict markers.
- Added worked example pages for vector/matrix-valued equations, complex-valued
  equations, and polynomial (`return_function`) solutions; the README now links
  to these rather than duplicating the code. README code blocks are now executed
  in CI (`pytest --markdown-docs`) alongside the docs examples.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-26

### Performance
- The callable-input solvers' **vector/matrix** weight-tensor build now uses the
  same batched smooth-block path as the scalar build (added in 0.6.0): the
  `(d, d)` kernel is sampled once per block per Gauss-Legendre order and combined
  with all basis functions via a single `einsum`, instead of a separate
  quadrature (with its own kernel evals and `polyval`) per basis function. The
  two-order convergence check and the scipy adaptive fallback for singular
  blocks are unchanged, and results are identical. Roughly **4× faster** for
  smooth vector/matrix kernels (e.g. `function_solve_VIE_2` at M=200, d=3:
  ~4.1 s → ~1.0 s). Removed the now-unused
  `_fixed_order_quad`/`_fixed_order_quad_matrix` helpers.
- Both the scalar and vector/matrix builds further batch the **off-diagonal
  blocks** across collocation nodes: since all `p` nodes of a step share the same
  integration interval `[t_l, t_{l+1}]` (only the kernel argument `tau_i - s`
  differs), the kernel is now sampled once across the whole `(p, order)` node grid
  and combined via one `einsum`, instead of once per node. Nodes whose declared
  singularity falls in a block are peeled off to the adaptive path, and the
  diagonal block (whose upper limit is `tau_i`) stays per-node. This is a further
  **~1.45×** for vector/matrix kernels (M=200, d=3: ~1.0 s → ~0.71 s, now ~1.2×
  the scalar path, down from ~7× before both changes) and **~1.37×** for scalar
  kernels (M=200: ~0.59 s → ~0.43 s). Results are unchanged: the optimized weight
  tensor matches a brute-force per-element reference to ~1e-12 in both the smooth
  and weakly-singular (Abel kernel) cases.
- The off-diagonal accept/store step is now **vectorized across collocation
  nodes** as well: the two-order convergence check and the weight-tensor write
  for a full block are done for all its smooth nodes in one indexed assignment,
  instead of a per-node Python loop, with only the rare failing pairs falling
  back to adaptive quadrature. A further **~1.4×** for vector/matrix kernels
  (M=200, d=3: ~0.71 s → ~0.50 s) and **~1.34×** for scalar kernels
  (M=200: ~0.43 s → ~0.32 s); results are again identical. Cumulatively over
  this release the smooth vector/matrix build is ~8× faster (M=200, d=3:
  ~4.1 s → ~0.50 s) and the scalar build ~1.8× faster than in 0.6.0.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-26

### Dependencies
- **`scipy` is now a core dependency** (was the `[callable]` extra), so the
  callable-input `function_solve_*` family works out of the box.
- **Recommended install is now `pip install voles[full]`**, which additionally
  pulls in `numba` for the array-based solvers' fallback on non-standard
  collocation settings. Plain `pip install voles` still gives a working package
  (numpy + scipy, no numba); see the README for slimmer install options if you
  hit trouble installing a dependency.
- The `[callable]` extra is retained as a no-op alias for backwards
  compatibility (scipy is now always installed).

### Performance
- The callable-input solvers (`function_solve_VIE_1/2/VIDE`) build the kernel
  weight tensor substantially faster. On each smooth quadrature block the kernel
  is now sampled once and combined with all basis functions via a small matmul
  (with the basis-at-nodes values precomputed), instead of repeating quadrature
  and `polyval` per basis function. Roughly 4× faster for smooth kernels and
  ~2.5× for weakly singular ones (whose adaptive diagonal blocks are unchanged);
  results are unchanged.

### Added
- The array-based solvers (`solve_VIE_1`, `solve_VIE_2`, `solve_VIDE`) accept
  `return_function=True`, returning a callable solution object as the second
  element of the tuple (matching the callable-input solvers). The object
  evaluates the piecewise polynomial at any time and also indexes/iterates like
  the previous list of per-interval polynomials, so existing code keeps working.

### Changed
- **`return_polys` is deprecated in favour of `return_function`** on the
  array-based solvers; it remains as an alias and now emits a
  `DeprecationWarning`. Its return value is the new callable solution object
  rather than a plain list (backward compatible via list-like access).
- **`optimal_graded_mesh` now takes `order` (int) instead of `coll_choices`**
  (breaking). Only the method order was ever used; pass
  `order=len(coll_choices)` to match the solver's collocation setting.
- `optimal_graded_mesh` returns a uniform mesh ($r = 1$) at `alpha == 0`,
  where the kernel is non-singular and grading would only waste resolution
  near the origin (previously used $r = $ order).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **Package renamed from `volterra-equation-solvers` to `voles`** (both
  the PyPI package name and the Python import root). Install with
  `pip install voles`; import with `import voles` (was
  `import volterra_equation_solvers`). The previous `0.4.0` name will
  still resolve on PyPI; a final `volterra-equation-solvers` release
  with a deprecation shim re-exporting from `voles` will land separately.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Callable-input solver family** alongside the existing array-based solvers:
  `function_solve_VIE_1`, `function_solve_VIE_2`, `function_solve_VIDE`. Each
  accepts `kernel(u)`, `g(t)`, and (for VIDE) `a(t)` as Python callables,
  runs on an arbitrary mesh via `mesh_breakpoints`, and supports scalar,
  vector, and matrix-valued cases plus complex-valued data
- Weakly singular convolution kernels supported via `kernel_singularity`
  (accepts a float, a list of floats, or a callable returning singular
  $s$-locations as a function of the collocation point — the last form
  is forward-compatible with non-convolution kernels)
- `optimal_graded_mesh(alpha, T, M, coll_choices)`: Brunner-graded mesh
  $t_n = T (n/M)^r$ with $r = p / (1-\alpha)$ for Abel-type problems with
  $K(u) \sim u^{-\alpha}$
- `return_function=True` on the callable-input solvers returns a callable
  wrapper exposing `.polynomials` and `.mesh_breakpoints`; evaluates the
  piecewise polynomial solution at any scalar or array of times
- VIE-1 `force_continuous` mode for the callable family (replaces one
  collocation equation per interval with a continuity constraint pinned
  to `soln_init_value`)
- Optional `[callable]` extra pulling in `scipy` (required for the new
  family). Existing array-based solvers and their dependency footprint
  are unchanged
- Robustness for complex inputs: multi-point sampling detects complex
  kernel/g/a/soln_init_value and routes through the block-decomposition
  trick; if sampling misses, numpy's `ComplexWarning` is escalated to a
  clear `ValueError` rather than silently dropping the imaginary part
- Foot-gun warning when `kernel_singularity` is declared but the mesh
  appears uniform, pointing at `optimal_graded_mesh`
- API-reference and example pages for the new solvers; README
  restructured to surface both families side-by-side per equation type
- Mesh-build stress tests on extreme width ratios and 500-interval meshes

### Fixed
- Array-based solvers now raise a clear `ValueError` when input length
  truncates to `mesh_divs = 0` (previously: silent truncation to `N=1`
  followed by the D extension aborting via an uncatchable
  `core.exception.ArrayIndexError`). Surfaced via a user-submitted
  notebook crash report
- Spurious "soln_init_value has no effect" warning fired once per column
  when matrix-valued `solve_VIE_1` was called without `soln_init_value`;
  now only fires when init is actually unused, and at most once per call

### Changed
- W-tensor builder caches Gauss–Legendre nodes/weights and uses
  vectorized integrand evaluation when the kernel callable broadcasts
  over numpy arrays — roughly an order of magnitude faster setup for
  typical numpy-style kernels on large meshes

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-15

### Removed
- **macOS x86_64 (Intel) wheel.** The GitHub-hosted `macos-13` runner is deprecated and currently capacity-starved; the cross-compile-plus-Rosetta-smoke-test alternative on `macos-latest` (arm64) does not produce a load-testable wheel in CI. Rather than ship an under-tested artifact, the platform is dropped. Intel Mac users can pin to `volterra-equation-solvers==0.3.1` (last tested x86_64 release) or build from source per CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Fixed
- Vector VIE-1/VIE-2/VIDE with `d > 8` (the compile-time threshold) no longer aborts the process when LAPACK is not linked into the D extension; a pure-D Gaussian-elimination fallback (`lin_solve_rt`) is used instead
- Singular or nearly singular coefficient matrices in the runtime-`d` LU path now raise `numpy.linalg.LinAlgError` instead of aborting the process via `assert`
- Singular-matrix signaling in the runtime-`d` LU path uses bool returns instead of D exceptions, avoiding access-violation crashes when LDC-emitted exception unwinding crosses the `extern(C)` boundary in Windows DLLs

### Added
- `dlang/meson.options`: new `with-lapack` feature option (`auto`/`enabled`/`disabled`) to force the build to skip LAPACK even when it is installed
- CI: new Linux job that builds with `-Dwith-lapack=disabled` to keep the LAPACK-less code path covered

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Wheels now include the compiled D extension (`.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`); previous wheels contained only Python files, causing `ImportError` on import

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

_Yanked: wheels missing compiled D extension (see 0.3.1)._

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Cross-platform D extension support: macOS (`.dylib`) and Windows (`.dll`) in addition to Linux (`.so`)
- CI jobs for macOS and Windows D extension builds
- `volterra_max_coll_params()` exported from D library; Python loader now queries it dynamically instead of using a hardcoded value
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development setup and D extension build instructions
- `SECURITY.md` describing the threat scope of the library
- PyPI metadata: keywords, classifiers, and project URLs
- Vector-valued solvers for VIE-1, VIE-2, and VIDE (D extension); `kernel_values` shape `(N, d, d)`, `g_values` shape `(N, d)`
- Matrix-valued solution support: pass `g_values` of shape `(N, d, m)` to solve `m` right-hand sides simultaneously; columns run in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- `force_continuous` and per-component `soln_init_value` support for vector VIE-1
- Benchmark suite extended with vector solver benchmarks (VIE-1, VIE-1 continuous, VIE-2, VIDE for d=2)
- `docs/scalar_solutions.pdf` and `docs/coupled_vector_solutions.pdf`: worked derivations of analytic test-case solutions
- PyPI wheel distribution workflow (`build-wheels.yml`): builds `manylinux_2_31` Linux wheel, macOS arm64/x86_64, Windows x64, and publishes via OIDC trusted publishing
- `check_convergence.py`: standalone script verifying convergence of all supported collocation settings

### Changed
- Expanded supported collocation settings from 39 to 84 combinations by raising `max_coll_divs` from 3 to 4 and `max_coll_params` from 3 to 5
- Non-convergent VIE-1 settings `(coll_divs=3, coll_choices=[1])`, `(4, [1])`, and `(4, [1, 2])` removed from the supported set; passing them now raises `ValueError`
- CI skips documentation-only pushes (`*.md`, `docs/`)
- D extension is now **required**; `ImportError` is raised at import time if the library is absent. Numba is retained only as a fallback for scalar solvers with collocation settings not covered by the D extension
- CI restructured: D extension is built once (Ubuntu 20.04 Docker, glibc ≤ 2.31) and the resulting artifact is reused across a Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13 test matrix
- Complexity table in README splits vector and matrix cases; notes that matrix columns run in parallel
- Input truncation consolidated into a single helper `_truncate_N` called once per solver (previously duplicated across scalar and vector code paths)
- Compiled extension binary (`.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`) removed from version control; must be built locally or installed via wheel

### Fixed
- Input truncation formula corrected: previously truncated to a valid length one step smaller than necessary (e.g. 42 → 37 instead of 42 → 41 for `coll_divs=2`). Now always truncates to the nearest valid length
- `scipy` restored as an explicit runtime dependency (required internally by Numba's linear algebra support)
- Windows DLL symbol visibility: changed `extern(C):` to `export extern(C):` in D source so entry points are correctly exported
- `supported_coll_settings_d()` no longer crashes after `max_coll_params` changes; buffer size is now derived from the library at runtime
- macOS build: removed `--strip-unneeded` flag (GNU-only) from meson strip target
- Benchmark CI: `git pull --rebase --autostash` prevents failure when `output.json` has unstaged changes

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- `solve_VIE_1`: collocation solver for Type-1 Volterra integral equations
- `solve_VIE_2`: collocation solver for Type-2 Volterra integral equations
- `solve_VIDE`: collocation solver for Volterra integro-differential equations
- `return_polys` option to retrieve piecewise polynomial solution
- `force_continuous` option for `solve_VIE_1`
